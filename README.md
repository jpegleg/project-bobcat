# project-bobcat üê±

Lightweight compute OS configurations for morpho-web-lt featuring FreeBSD and OpenBSD nodes.

See the application source code for morpho-web-lt here: https://github.com/jpegleg/morpho-web-lt

This repository is for the operating system configurations for ultra low power systems. 
The morpho-web-lt application is a web server, which we'll run in project-bobcat on two
FreeBSD nodes. The ingress to the two FreeBSD nodes is two OpenBSD nodes which run HAProxy and pf firewall.
